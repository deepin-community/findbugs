Packaging TODOs:

* clean up the help2man output for findbugs and fb, or simply
  replace these with hand-written manpages.  (See the generated
  manpages for examples of the issues in the Description field,
  etc.)

* organize/combine the patches into categories, such as:
  - build system changes
  - porting for Debian
